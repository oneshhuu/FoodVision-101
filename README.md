This project is based on Natural Language Processing. It uses different types of embeddings for pre-processing data and many different types of model architectures to compare and find the best performing model. Unlike other projects, this is a rather comprehensive project which combines my knowledge of different types of NLP architectures and embeddings all into one. This model labels the abstracts from PubMed papers into four categories, to categorize the whole paper so that it is easy to read.
The types of architecutres used in this notebook are:
* TF-IDF Multinomial Naive Bayes.
* Conv1D with token embeddings.
* Feature extraction with pre-trained token embeddings.
* Conv1D with character level Embeddings.
* Hybrid embedding layer combining pre-trained embeddings and token embeddings.
* Tribrid embedding layer combining pre-trained embeddings, token embeddings and positional embeddings.
